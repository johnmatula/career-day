		<p>I’ve always enjoyed design, and I grew up interested in computers. That said, I stumbled into website building totally by accident. I stick with it because of its ever-evolving state.</p>
    
    <h2>👦🏻 A Brief History of Young John</h2>
    <p>When I was about 7, I was playing around on the family computer and stumbled on a program I had never heard of. It kind of looked like Microsoft Word, except that I could add buttons and toggles and things. This ended up being how I made my first website:</p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="" />
      <figcaption>My first website. Those buttons didn’t work.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>As I kept playing around, I figured out that I was adding HTML to the page (who knew!) and had my first goal of getting those buttons to do something.</p>
    
    <h2>🎓 What Helped in Middle and High School</h2>
    <p>In addition to learning on your own, the most helpful classes are math and science! You’ll be a better critical thinker and will calculate counts and sizes as you design.
    
    <h2>♿️➕🧓➕📱 Everyone’s Included</h2>
    <p>There are plenty of reasons why I enjoy working with websites. If I had to pick one, it would be that well-designed sites can accommodate people of all physical and mental abilities in all situations.</p>
